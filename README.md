# SURA Review Tone Experiment

This repository contains a research project conducted under the Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship (SURA) at Carnegie Mellon University. The study tests how online review tone, product type, and rating variance affect consumer purchase intent and product attitude.

## Project Background

Consumers use both star ratings and written reviews to evaluate products. Prior studies often look at these elements in isolation. This project evaluates them together in a full-factorial design. It asks: How do tone, product category, and rating variance shape buying decisions?

The study simulates online product pages. Participants see different combinations of review tone, star rating variance, and product type. They rate their attitude and purchase intent. Responses are measured using 7-point Likert scales.

## Study Design

- 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 between-subjects experiment
- N = 359
- Factors:
  - **Review Tone**: Emotional vs. Functional
  - **Product Type**: Hedonic (perfume) vs. Utilitarian (USB drive)
  - **Star Rating Variance**: High vs. Low
- Outcomes:
  - Purchase Intent (2-item average)
  - Attitude Toward Product (2-item average)
  - Influence of Star Ratings
  - Influence of Written Reviews

## Hypotheses and Reasoning

### H1

**For utilitarian products under low-variance conditions, functional tone will lower product evaluations compared to emotional tone.**

When star ratings show low variance, consumers trust that most reviews agree. For utilitarian products like a USB, people focus on performance. Functional reviews match this mindset. If they include criticism, that criticism appears more credible and serious.

In contrast, emotional reviews are easier to dismiss. Negative content seems subjective or mood-driven. Emotional framing also evokes a positive feeling, which can raise overall product attitude. This makes emotional tone more persuasive than functional tone under low risk.

### H2

**This tone Ã— product effect will disappear under high variance.**

When star ratings are spread out, consumers become cautious. They seek clear, diagnostic cues. Emotional tone loses power in this context. Functional tone becomes more useful. In these high-variance settings, functional reviews do not hurt utilitarian products the same way they do under low variance.

The emotional advantage disappears because affective cues are harder to trust when risk is high.

## Tools

- **R**: Data cleaning using dummy dataset (see `data-cleaning-r/`)
- **SPSS**: Statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests)
- **Tableau**: Dashboard and data visualization
- **Qualtrics**: Survey delivery and randomization


## Key Insights

- **Review tone alone does not affect purchase intent** for utilitarian products under low variance. H1 was not supported.
- **Three-way interaction was significant** for purchase intent *(p = .039)*. It was marginally significant for attitude *(p = .059)*.
- Under **high variance and functional tone**, hedonic products scored higher than utilitarian:
  - Attitude *(p = .003)*
  - Purchase Intent *(p = .007)*
- Under **low variance and emotional tone**, hedonic again outperformed utilitarian:
  - Attitude *(p = .011)*
  - Purchase Intent *(p = .042)*
- **Gender differed significantly across conditions** *(p = .030)*

## Recommendations

Use this research to improve how product reviews are structured and surfaced online.
- If you **manage marketing for lifestyle or sensory products** (e.g., beauty, fragrance, leisure tech), **curate and promote emotional reviews** when customer ratings are consistent.

- If you **work with practical or performance-based products** (e.g., electronics, tools, accessories) and your reviews are inconsistent, **downplay functional review content** in your product display.

- If you **sell utilitarian products with consistently high ratings**, **focus on pricing, shipping, or guarantee messaging** instead of managing consumersâ€™ reviews and tone visibility.

- If you **design review displays or recommendation engines**, **feature well-written review content above star summaries** to support better product evaluations since participants rated written reviews as more influential than star ratings on average.
