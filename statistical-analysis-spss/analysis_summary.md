# SPSS Analysis Summary

All formal analysis was conducted in SPSS.

## Tests Performed

- 3-way ANOVA (Review Tone × Product Type × Variance) for Purchase Intent and Attitude
- Follow-up independent-sample t-tests comparing specific cell means
- Gender included as a covariate in secondary models

## Significant Effects

- 3-way interaction for Purchase Intent: F = 4.288, p = .039
- Marginal 3-way interaction for Attitude: F = 3.562, p = .059

## Significant Post-Hoc Comparisons (All p < .05)

- **High Variance, Functional Tone**  
  - Attitude scores were significantly higher for the hedonic product than the utilitarian product:  
    - t = -3.056, p = .003  
  - Purchase intent scores were significantly higher for the hedonic product than the utilitarian product:  
    - t = -2.707, p = .007

- **Low Variance, Emotional Tone**  
  - Attitude scores were significantly higher for the hedonic product than the utilitarian product:  
    - t = -2.551, p = .011  
  - Purchase intent scores were significantly higher for the hedonic product than the utilitarian product:  
    - t = -2.047, p = .042

## Non-Significant Results

- Product Type × Review Tone interaction under Low Variance (H1)  
  - Attitude: F = 1.610, p = .205  
  - Purchase Intent: F = 1.660, p = .198

- All other post-hoc comparisons had p-values greater than .1
